🧾 About

The Online Quiz Application is a web-based project developed to test users’ knowledge in Computer Science through a set of 10 multiple-choice questions.
Each question carries equal marks and comes with a 60-second timer, enhancing focus and excitement.

This project aims to provide an interactive platform for students or learners to participate in quiz competitions, analyze their scores, and compare their performance with others through a Leaderboard.

The design uses bright colors, modern animations, and a user-friendly layout that ensures smooth navigation between the login, quiz, and result pages.

It supports both frontend-only (Local Storage) functionality and backend integration (MongoDB) for real-time data storage.

✨ Features

User Authentication – Create account and Login pages using Local Storage.

Welcome Page with Rules – Displays quiz rules, instructions, and a “Start Quiz” button.

Timed Quiz – Each question has a 60-second countdown timer.

Progress Bar – Visual progress indicator above the questions.

Leaderboard – Displays top 5 scores dynamically fetched from MongoDB or stored locally.

Review Answers – Shows only the wrongly answered questions with correct solutions.

Responsive & Animated UI – Modern gradient theme with smooth transitions and mobile-friendly design.

Local Storage Integration – Saves user session, quiz progress, and offline scores.

Backend APIs – RESTful API endpoints for questions, submissions, and leaderboard.

Error Handling & Validation – Input validation for login/signup and graceful error handling for API failures.
